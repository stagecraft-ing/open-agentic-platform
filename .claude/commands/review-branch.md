# Review Branch

Perform a comprehensive read-only review of the current git branch changes.

**CRITICAL: This is a READ-ONLY review. Do NOT:**
- Make any code changes
- Create or modify files
- Run git commands (commit, push, merge, etc.)
- Only exception: You may run git commands to READ information (diff, log, status, show)

**Steps:**

1. Run `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes in the branch
2. Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to see commit history (for context only, not for analysis)
3. Run `git status` to see current state

**Analysis Required:**

Provide your review in the following format:

## Branch Summary
[Brief 2-3 sentence description of what this branch does]

## Detailed Findings

### Database Changes
[List any schema changes, migrations, new tables/columns, or note "None"]

### Security Issues
[List potential security vulnerabilities:]
- XSS vulnerabilities
- SQL injection risks
- Exposed secrets/API keys
- Authentication/authorization gaps
- Unsafe deserialization
- Missing input validation
[Note "None found" if clean]

### Performance Concerns
[List potential performance issues:]
- N+1 queries
- Inefficient loops or algorithms
- Memory leaks
- Missing database indexes
- Large payload sizes
- Unnecessary re-renders
[Note "None found" if clean]

### Cross-Platform Compatibility (macOS / Windows / Linux)
[Check for platform-specific issues that could break functionality on different operating systems:]
- **File paths**: Hardcoded separators (/ vs \) instead of path.join() or path.resolve()
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Hardcoded 'Meta' or 'Cmd' instead of platform-aware shortcuts (should use 'CmdOrCtrl' or detect platform)
- **Environment variables**: Platform-specific env vars (e.g., HOME vs USERPROFILE, XDG paths)
- **System commands**: Bash/shell commands that don't work on Windows (should use cross-platform alternatives)
- **File system case sensitivity**: Code assuming case-insensitive file systems (macOS/Windows) that will break on Linux
- **Line endings**: Missing .gitattributes or code that assumes LF vs CRLF
- **Native dependencies**: Binaries or node modules that need platform-specific builds
- **Process handling**: Platform-specific process spawning or signal handling
- **File permissions**: Unix-style chmod/permissions that don't translate to Windows
- **Path length limits**: Windows MAX_PATH (260 char) limitations not accounted for
[Note "Fully compatible" or "Not applicable" if clean]

### Dependencies
[Check package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, or other manifests for changes:]
- New packages added: [name@version - purpose]
- Version updates: [name: old -> new]
- Removed packages: [name]
[Note "No changes" if none]

### Logging Assessment
[Evaluate if logging is appropriate, too verbose, or missing. Note any debug prints or console.log that should be removed]

### Type Safety Issues
[List any `any` types, missing type definitions, type assertions, unsafe casts, or untyped function signatures that should be reviewed]

### Potential Bugs
[List specific scenarios that should be tested, edge cases not handled, null checks missing, etc.]
- Bug 1: [description]
- Bug 2: [description]

### Cleanup Needed
[List commented code, debug statements, unused imports, TODOs, etc.]
- Item 1: [description + file:line]
- Item 2: [description + file:line]

### Other Concerns
[Any additional issues not covered above:]
- Breaking changes to APIs or interfaces
- Missing error handling
- Accessibility issues
- Missing documentation
- Test coverage gaps

## Suggested Commit Message
[Provide a well-formatted commit message for the entire branch following the project's commit style, but DO NOT create the commit]

## File-by-File Analysis

| File | Changes Summary |
| --- | --- |
| path/to/file1 | [Explain what changed and why - focus on WHAT and WHY, not line-by-line details] |
| path/to/file2 | [Explain what changed and why - focus on WHAT and WHY, not line-by-line details] |
| path/to/file3 | [Explain what changed and why - focus on WHAT and WHY, not line-by-line details] |
