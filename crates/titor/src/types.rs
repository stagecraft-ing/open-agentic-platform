//! Core data types used throughout the Titor library
//!
//! This module contains fundamental data structures that are shared across
//! different components of the library.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The types in this module represent:
//! - **File System State**: `FileEntry`, `FileManifest` - representing files and their metadata
//! - **Operations**: `RestoreResult`, `CheckpointDiff`, `ChangeStats` - results of various operations
//! - **Configuration**: `TitorConfig`, `CheckpointOptions`, `RestoreOptions` - operation parameters
//! - **Storage**: `StorageObject`, `StorageMetadata` - internal storage representations
//! - **Hooks**: `CheckpointHook` - extensibility points for custom behavior
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use titor::types::{CheckpointOptions, FileEntry};
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//! 
//! // Configure checkpoint creation
//! let options = CheckpointOptions {
//!     description: Some("Release v1.0".to_string()),
//!     tags: vec!["release".to_string(), "production".to_string()],
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//! ```
